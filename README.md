## üß† Concept Origin

After announcing my exit from the IT industry in 2024, I (Parth Shah) return with AIRWORLD ‚Äî my boldest vision yet.

Having built the multiplayer hit **Sequel5** (125,000+ downloads), this project goes far beyond games, entering the realm of **digital societies**, **sovereign kingdoms**, and **mind-interactive technology**.
